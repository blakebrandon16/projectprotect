# ProjectProtect

ProjectProtect is a lightweight cybersecurity tool designed to prevent common human mistakes that lead to data leaks, phishing attacks, and doxxing.

## Problem
Most security breaches don’t come from elite hackers — they come from everyday users clicking suspicious links, leaking credentials, or oversharing personal information.

## Solution
ProjectProtect acts as a last line of defense by analyzing text and links before they are shared. It warns users about:

- Phishing links
- Leaked passwords or API keys
- Exposure of personal information (doxxing risk)

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- HTML / CSS
- Regex-based security detection

## How to Run
```bash
pip install flask
python app.py
